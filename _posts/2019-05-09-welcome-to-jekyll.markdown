It's not that personal blogs were dead or anything but since Facebook et al gave us centralized platforms for our thoughts and images it's kind of hard reading about peoples doing without being part in these systems. 

Facebook is dying a slow death (at least public content wise and of various reasons) and people looking forward using other platforms. Medium for example did a great job attracting reading and writing folks. Although the overall design is great for writing and reading, Medium as well is generating nothing but the platform itself. Everytime someone writes a story for a specific audience, he or she is also writing for Medium.

With that in mind it's the distribution channels we are looking for. If I write a blog post (like this particualr one) I also share it on Twitter. Yes, I know - it maybe is a bit sloppy, deviding platforms into just two segmentations: content and distribution. For the sake of this post lets keep it that simple.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
